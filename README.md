# CAMP
Connect and Meet People (CAMP) is an app designed to connect local communities and combat isolation.
This app was created for CS 3744 (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction) at Virginia Tech.
Please check out the Group Project Demo for an overview of the project. The other files included are documentation of our team's creation process if you want a deeper look at CAMP.
